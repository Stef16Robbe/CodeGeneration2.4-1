## Swagger generated server
This is a swagger based Spring Boot Server.
Our API specification is made in SwaggerHub: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Inholland_623434/Swagger_Specification_3B/2

## Heroku
We have deployed our REST API to Heroku. Heroku is assigned with GitHub so all new commits in the master branche will deploy automaticly to heroku.

We have created a postman collection for functional testing. The public collection URL: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11069108/SztHWjhL

## Frontend
We also made a frontend website for the REST API. The path for the frontend is : /src/main/resources/public/Home.html

## Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

Start your server as an simple java application  

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to
